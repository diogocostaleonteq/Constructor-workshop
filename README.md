# Constructor Workshop Chat Application

## Overview

This project is a chat application built using Scala and SBT. It consists of a client and server component that communicate using Protocol Buffers (ScalaPB). The server handles login, logout, and chat message requests, while the client interacts with the server to perform these actions.

## Project Structure

- `src/main/scala/com/leonteq/workshop/chat/client/ChatClientToolkit.scala`: Contains the client toolkit for handling login, logout, and chat message requests.
- `src/main/scala/com/leonteq/workshop/chat/server/StartConstructorWorkshop.scala`: Main entry point for starting the chat server.
- `src/main/scala/com/leonteq/workshop/chat/server/handlers/LoginRequestHandler.scala`: Handles login requests on the server side.

## Prerequisites

- Scala
- SBT (Scala Build Tool)
- Java Development Kit (JDK)

## Running the Application

### Running the Server

Use the provided run configuration to start the server by selecting `StartConstructorWorkshop` and clicking the run button.

### Running the Client

Use the provided run configuration to start the client by selecting `ChatClientMain#` and clicking the run button.
You can create more client running configurations by duplicating the existing one and changing the client name number.

You can open multiple terminal windows and run the client command in each to simulate multiple clients.

## Configuration

The server configuration is defined in the `ConstructorWorkshopConfig` class. You can modify the configuration settings as needed.

## Health Checks

The server includes a health check mechanism that monitors the number of online users. If the number of online users exceeds 10, the server is marked as unhealthy.

## Logging

The application uses `StrictLogging` for logging. Logs are generated for various actions such as handling login requests and registering health checks.
